# Honk-more-wait-more
# Introduction

People in India frequently honk for no apparent reason, annoying others and contributing to noise pollution. This idea encourages individuals to honk less since the more they honk while waiting at a red light, the longer they will have to wait. 

This concept is based on a device that Mumbai police implemented to combat the problem of "reckless honkers," which resets the red traffic light if the sound of automobile horns exceeds a particular decibel level. The "punishing signal" is another name for it.
# Core idea behind this
The sound sensor accepts the input as the total of the loudness of the vehicles' honking and resets the waiting time to 30 seconds if the value reaches a specific limit, in our case 286.
